"""Model-health checks for the C1 app: when to refresh the margin and when to retrain.

A Phase 3 monitoring design (1 Nov 2026), added after the test months; not part of the tested model.
The margin was set so that our promise is late no more often than Olist's quote on the same orders
(9.51% on the validation folds). The checks ask whether that still holds on recent orders:

- late_now:     deliveries of the last 7 days, ours against Olist's: an early warning.
- margin_check: orders bought 32 to 60 days earlier, by when about 99% have arrived (95% of orders
                arrive within 32 days). A week is flagged when our late rate differs from Olist's on
                these orders by more than two paired standard errors; also gives the margin that
                would match Olist. The margin in use stays fixed: the app suggests, and asks for a
                review only after REVIEW_WEEKS flagged weeks in a row in the same direction. Orders still open count against us: late for ours, and late for Olist
                only once already past Olist's date.
                Retrain when the estimate's MAE on these orders is above the worst validation fold.

Every function takes the scored test orders and a moment T, and uses only what is known at T.
